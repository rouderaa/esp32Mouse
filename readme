The classes PS2Com and PS2Mouse enable you to interface your ESP32 system with a PS2 compatible USB mouse. (mouse with three buttons and a scroll-wheel) Most USB mouses still support the PS2 protocol to be compatible. 
Why would you want to interface a mouse to your ESP32 system you may ask ? Well, a mouse can be used as a very precise and cheap way to monitor the movement of your self build robot if attached to the bottom of it, for example. Another nice thing is that a mouse often has a scroll button that now can be easily read in your ESP32 code. And you can use the three buttons of the mouse as digital inputs for your project, all using just 2 IO lines on your ESP32. See the main.cpp file for an example for the usual Arduino interface with a begin() and loop() function. The values of the PS2Mouse like x, y, scroll wheel etc. can be obtained using the corresponding getter operations of the PS2Mouse class.
Note that your mouse will not be hot plugable, it must be attached to your ESP32 at powerup. The code uses one interrupt. For the wiring details of your mouse to the ESP32 see the comments in the main.cpp example usage file.
I have tested 4 types of mice that I had available, one was not compatible with PS2 and so did not work. The others worked correct.
This project would not have been possible without the excellent digital hardware debugging tool DSView from DreamSourceLab (www.dreamsourcelab.com).
Have fun with your Esp32 project !
